Scrolls of Knowledge:

- Use Map API, so right click opens readable scroll
- Shows "Cost to learn", and if user selects "Learn now", the cost is taken from their economy
- Maps use 'data' for storing their ID - combine with enchantment to 'convert' to scroll
- Use 2nd enchantment to denote a copy (so libraries won't buy them)
- Have each type of knowledge scroll map to a ID - eg #1 may be "mining"

+ Allows future teaching of NPC's



Library of Knowledge

- Right clicking a bookshelf with a libraian NPC within x blocks
- Can donate scrolls of knowledge to the library
- Players can get a copy of a knowledge scoll for x% of it's current worth 

+ Towns can have libraries, which serve a purpose. Players can sell spare scrolls to libraries
.. later, library could have a budget (as part of a town) - fee's go in, and offers to buy new scrolls go out, so players can make money selling unique spares.



Chests of Knowledge

- Selected chests in the world spawn scrolls of knowledge inside them
- Each chest has a range of worths (eg 5000-10000) set by admin
- Chests have timeouts - they may only generate a new scroll (pr player) once a week
- Each player, on opening, see's a unique inventory - with a single scroll in it.
- What scroll is generated depends on the worth figure.

+ Can design large dungeons, assign worth's to chests based on difficulty, and have game add knowledge randomly, pr player
  .. hard to farm, all players get rewards, can be balanced with surroundings..

--> Repalce - have bookshelfs (same sort of settings), and a chance (pr player, pr bookshelf 'group') for scrolls to drop on right click (serach)
  .. only works once pr self (until regen time is over)
  .. chance massively decreases for each scroll found
  .. worth is based as above
  .. each players chance is seperate
  
  

Dungeon generator

- Procedural dungeons ('start here, you can go x radius, x depth, make it y hard)
- Include chests of knowledge at end
- can build off work of http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/catacombs/  - which is GPL'd

+ Later, add automatic mode - generate a dungon every x chunks (where there's room for it), and increase base value by y (distance from spawn * y)
.. so later on, can set a worldborder, generate the map, and have dungeons and all included within it.
.. much later, can replace strongholds and dungeons of vanilla when doing a custom land generator.
